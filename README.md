1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to a TV game “Win, Lose or Draw”, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The Gaming Room wanted to develop their game on multiple platforms, currently only available on Android. The application needs to be able to render images from a library. Images need to be rendered at a set rate and are fully complete after the 30-second mark. The client is hoping to expand their audience.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  In my Evaluation section, I feel I made a very detailed list of each platform possibility. I added detailed lists of pros and cons for each platform. I focused on the tool available, the popularity of each platform, and how storage could be managed. Looking at the data would help the clients make a choice on which platform to proceed with for developing their web-based applications.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I think that developing a UML Diagram made it easier to write the code. In the diagram, it shows each script’s relation to each other. This helps when developing the scripts needed.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would choose to revise my requirement section. I believe my requirements are too shallow and need to be in more depth. Adding requirements such adding round limits, an operating scoreboard, or individual profiles for the players.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
	The client gave us a list of requirements such as the need for storage, timers, and teams. When developing the code, you look at the requirements given to us by the client. We need to consider the user’s needs because we are producing the software for the client. They need their prior project to be reflected in their web-based application.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
	In the beginning, we had to analyze what the client was asking of us. Writing out all the requirements and the summary was the start. Next, I would start writing pseudocode to help with planning the code itself. When writing the code, running tests is important to make sure that the code is reacting the way it is supposed to.
